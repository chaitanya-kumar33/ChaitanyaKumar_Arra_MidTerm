        "\n",
        "2) Counting Frequency: The function count_frequency checks how many transactions contain a given itemset. Itemsets that meet the minimum support threshold are considered frequent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Generating Association Rules: We then generate association rules for the frequent itemsets using the basic \"if A, then B\" format. Confidence is calculated based on the proportion of transactions containing A that also contain B.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Stopping Criteria: The algorithm terminates when no frequent k-itemsets are found.\n",

        "Output Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Frequent Itemsets: Itemsets with their support count.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Association Rules: Rules of the form \"A -> B\" along with their support and confidence values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Brute Force Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is computationally expensive because it generates all possible itemsets and checks each one. However, it ensures that no frequent itemsets are missed. Optimizations like pruning can help reduce the search space in other algorithms like Apriori, but brute force ensures completeness."
